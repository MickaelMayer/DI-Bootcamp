# Challenge 1
# Ask the user for a number and a length.
# Create a program that prints a list of multiples of the number until the list length reaches length.
# Examples

# number: 7 - length 5 ➞ [7, 14, 21, 28, 35]

# number: 12 - length 10 ➞ [12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120]

# number: 17 - length 6 ➞ [17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102]

number = int(input("write a number"))
length = int (input("choose a lenght"))
count = 0

while count < length:
    print(number)
    number *=2
    count+=1



# ======================================
# Write a program that asks a string to the user, and display a new string with any duplicate consecutive letters removed.
# Examples

# user's word : "ppoeemm" ➞ "poem"

# user's word : "wiiiinnnnd" ➞ "wind"

# user's word : "ttiiitllleeee" ➞ "title"

# user's word : "cccccaaarrrbbonnnnn" ➞ "carbon"
# Notes
# Final strings won’t include words with double letters (e.g. “passing”, “lottery”).

crazy_word = input("white a word with duplicate letters")

final_word = " "
