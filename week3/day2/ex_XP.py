# Exercise 1 : Pets
# Instructions
# Using this code:


# Create another cat breed named Siamese which inherits from the Cat class.
# Create a list called all_cats, which holds three cat instances : one Bengal, one Chartreux and one Siamese.
# Those three cats are Sara‚Äôs pets. Create a variable called sara_pets which value is an instance of the Pet class, and pass the variable all_cats to the new instance.
# Take all the cats for a walk, use the walk method.

# üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions
# Create a class called Dog with the following attributes name, age, weight.
# Implement the following methods in the Dog class:
# bark: returns a string which states: ‚Äú<dog_name> is barking‚Äù.
# run_speed: returns the dogs running speed (weight/age*10).
# fight : takes a parameter which value is another Dog instance, called other_dog. This method returns a string stating which dog won the fight. The winner should be the dog with the higher run_speed x weight.

# Create 3 dogs and run them through your class.

# ============================================
# üåü Exercise 3 : Dogs Domesticated
# Instructions
# Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.
# In the new python file, create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.
# Add an attribute called trained to the __init__ method, this attribute is a boolean and the value should be False by default.
# Add the following methods:
# train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True

# play: takes a parameter which value is a few names of other Dog instances (use *args). The method should print the following string: ‚Äúdog_names all play together‚Äù.

# do_a_trick: If the dog is trained the method should print one of the following sentences at random:
# ‚Äúdog_name does a barrel roll‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name stands on his back legs‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name shakes your hand‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name plays dead‚Äù.

# Exercise 4 : Family
# Instructions
# Create a class called Family and implement the following attributes:
# members: list of dictionaries

# Exercise 5 : TheIncredibles Family
# Instructions
